### Tuts+ Tutorial: iOS Blur Effects

#### Instructor: Sandeep S Kumar

With iOS 7, we saw a shift in Apple's design paradigm for mobile devices. Not only did they adopt the so-called flat design, but Apple also added a few elements to this pattern themselves. One of these additions was the use of blurred-translucent backgrounds to convey the notion of depth and context through out their UI. Take Control Center for instance it - blurs the contents of the screen as it gets pulled up. This gives us the sense that it is hierarchically above the other contents of the screen and hence deserve focus. It does so without making us lose sense of where we are in the app. 

Though blur is used system wide in  iOS 7, Cocoa Touch does not provide us with any APIs to achieve this effect directly. In this tutorial, I'll walk you through a few methods to create blurred views by creating a demo app.
